                I'm a Back-end Developer. After few years of college nursing programming, I realized I wanted a new career where I could use
                my love and passions. That's where programming language came in and I decided to dedicate three months to
                learning to code at <a id="theIronYard" href="https://www.theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard.</a>
                <br><br>Outside of work, I love watching Major League Baseball, going to the church events and watching movies
